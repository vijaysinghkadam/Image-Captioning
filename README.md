# Image-Captioning
---

The goal of image captioning is to convert a given input image into a natural language description. The encoder-decoder framework is widely used for this task. The image encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this tutorial, we used resnet-152 model pretrained on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS image classification dataset. The decoder is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.
